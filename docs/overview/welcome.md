# Welcome to Cito

**Ensure data trust and let your business stakeholders consume data with confidence. Cito is here to help with powerful data observability powered by column-level lineage.**

## Rich Data Observability Needed

It just came to your attention that something unusual is going on with a specific set of your data. Thatâ€™s important to know, but unfortunately you have no idea what impact this might have on your data environment or where this problem is suddenly coming from.

Instantly, several questions are running through your head:

* Is this a major incident that threatens to skew several business metrics across our BI tools, or is this an incident on a column that I wanted to deprecate anyways, since nobody uses it anymore?
* Do my business stakeholders already know about this?
* Who else should know about this?
* And why did this happen anyways? Is there a problem with the source data again?

If only you didn't have to stumble across data anomalies by coincidence but could always be in the know and instantly understand data issues in the desperately needed context. **Cito Data hears you!**

## How Cito Helps
Cito automatically generates [column-level lineage](../functionalities/column-level-lineage) based on your dbt, Snowflake and BI tool resources. The lineage serves as the underlying infrastructure for our hands-off [data observability](../functionalities/anomaly-detection) capabilities to allow you to quickly understand the impact of detected anomalies as well as the corresponding root cause. Allowing you to instantly understand the downstream impact of a particular anomaly not only enables you to better prioritize your work, it also helps you to naturally track down the corresponding root cause and to resolve the incident in no time.
