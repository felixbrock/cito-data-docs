# Welcome to Cito Data

**Ensure data trust and let your business teams consume data with confidence. Cito Data is here to help with distributed data observability powered by column-level lineage.**

## Rich Data Observability Needed

It just came to your attention that something unusual is happening with a specific set of your data. Thatâ€™s important to know, but unfortunately you have no idea what impact this might have on your data environment or where this problem is suddenly coming from.

Instantly, several questions are running through your head:

* Is this a major incident that threatens to skew several business metrics across our BI tools, or is this an incident on a column that I wanted to deprecate anyways, since nobody uses it anymore?
* Do my business stakeholders already know about this?
* Who should I contact?
* And why is this happening anyways? Is there a problem with the source data again?

If there just was a way to not only stumble across data anomalies but instantly understand them in the desperately needed context. **Cito Data hears you!**

## How Cito Data Helps
Cito Data automatically generates end-to-end [column-level lineage](../functionalities/column-level-lineage) based on your dbt, Snowflake and Looker resources. The lineage serves as the underlying infrastructure for our hands-off [data observability](../functionalities/anomaly-detection) capabilities to allow you to quickly understand the impact of detected anomalies as well as the corresponding root cause of the problem. Allowing you to instantly understand the downstream impact of a particular anomaly does not only enable you to better prioritize your work, it also helps you to naturally trace down the corresponding root cause and fix it in no time. To provide transparency on anomalies and lineage and to help you build data trust among data consumers, Cito Data allows you to directly access lineage and data observability information in Looker via a [Chrome extension](../functionalities/distributed-data-observability).
