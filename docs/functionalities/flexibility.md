# Flexibility

Cito allows you to apply various test execution schedules on a table and column level (from hourly to daily executions). This allows you to apply a higher test execution frequency, for example hourly, to tables and columns that are especially important to you.

We generally recommend high test execution frequencies as this will allow the Cito model to become more accurate in the context of your business in a shorter period of time. As our pricing is based on test executions, we provide you with maximum flexibility from a cost perspective. Our usage-based pricing does not only allow you to use Cito flexibly, but it also provides you with a larger degree of flexibility to optimize your Snowflake usage than other observability solutions do.
