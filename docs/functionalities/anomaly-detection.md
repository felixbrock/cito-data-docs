# Anomaly Detection

Cito Data provides out-of-the-box data observability capabilities. In a 1-click operation,  you can define a new automated anomaly test from a variety of testing scenarios (e.g. Distribution, Freshness or Nullness). By running hourly time-series analysis against your meta-data and data in Snowflake and dbt we provide you with frequent visualized data quality insights on a table- and column-level. You will instantly be alerted via Slack should an anomaly occur. In case you receive an anomaly alert about a false positive, you have the opportunity to provide feedback to the model via a 1-click operation to improve its accuracy for future checks. Combined with our powerful visualizations, time-series insights, Slack alerting functionality and [column-level lineage](./column-level-lineage), you gain a powerful understanding of the big picture, which enables you to take action instantly. To establish data trust across your organization, you can enable continuous data-quality transparency by making use of our [distributed data observability](./distributed-data-observability) capabilities.
