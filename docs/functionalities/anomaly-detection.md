# Anomaly Detection

Cito provides out-of-the-box data observability capabilities. In a 1-click operation,  you can define a new automated anomaly test from a variety of testing scenarios (e.g. Distribution, Freshness, Nullness etc.). By running hourly time-series analysis against your metadata and data in Snowflake and dbt we provide you with frequent visualized data quality insights on a table- and column-level. 

You will instantly be alerted via Slack should an anomaly occur. In case you receive an anomaly alert about a false positive, you have the opportunity to provide feedback to the model via a 1-click operation to improve its accuracy going forward. Combined with our powerful visualizations, time-series insights, Slack alerting functionality and [column-level lineage](./column-level-lineage), you gain a powerful understanding of the big picture, which enables you to take action instantly.

Our model improves over time as it learns to understand your particular business context. Please allow 10 test executions for the model to detect the first anomalies.
