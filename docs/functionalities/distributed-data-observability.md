# Distributed Data Observability

Cito Dataâ€™s mission is to help you build data trust across the whole organization. By installing the Cito Data Chrome extension you can allow data consumers to access [data observability](./anomaly-detection.md) and [column-level lineage](./column-level-lineage) information right from the Looker dashboard. Cito Data enables a variety of stakeholders to consume BI layer metrics alongside the most recent data quality insights on the go, allowing them to make better decisions with more confidence.
