# BI Tools

Cito seamlessly integrates with various BI tools to provide you with true end-to-end column-level lineage and to allow you to easily understand the downstream impact of data anomalies.

## Mode, Tableau and Metabase

Simply connect your Mode, Tableau, or Metabase dashboard(s) to your Snowflake instance and Cito will automatically generate end to end lineage allowing you to see exactly which columns a particular dashboard depends on and how anomalies in your data may be affecting your BI tools.

**Lineage with other BI tools (e.g. Looker) is currently being developed and will be available soon.**
