1. Open the Integrations window in your Cito web app.
2. Open the Slack tab and click on ‘Add to Slack’. A Slack OAuth window appears to grant Cito access. You may need to log in.
3. To grant Cito access to the names of available public channels and to provide write permission to those channels click on Allow.
4. In the Cito web app choose a Slack channel to send alerts and anomaly context information to.
