# Slack

You want to setup your Github integration beforehand, since we need to check for anomalies in your data before sending you anomaly alerts.

Cito alerts you and provides you with essential information to act fast in case of an anomaly. For this purpose, the solution seamlessly integrates with Slack. In order to connect, please follow the steps below:

1. Open the Integrations window in your Cito web app.
2. Open the Slack tab and click on ‘Add to Slack’. A Slack OAuth window appears to grant Cito access. You may need to log in.
3. To grant Cito access to the names of available public channels and to provide write permission to those channels click on Allow.
4. You will automatically be redirected to the web-app lineage screen. In the Cito web app choose a Slack channel to send alerts and anomaly context information to. Please note that private Slack channels will not be visibile in the list.
